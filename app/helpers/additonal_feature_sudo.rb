# Activate Identical game action and logic for first and second hand seporately
# Create a Hand 1 and hand 2 container
# possible re-think database storage with hand 1 and hand 2 columns

# Fairly simple implemantation
# check value of player hand
# if hand is less than 11 then show a double button
# Double will trigger session[:bet] and multiply it by 2
# Display a double tag to the player
# only one card is deleverd to that hand
